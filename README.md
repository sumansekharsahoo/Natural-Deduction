## Part 1: Building Parse Tree for proposition logic formula
- Converting the Infix propositional logic expression into a Prefix propositional logic expression
- Converting the prefix expression into a rooted binary parse tree
- Function to traverse the parse tree to output the infix expression
- Computing the height of a parse tree
- Evaluating the truth value of a propositional logic formula

## Part 2: Checking if the proof statement is correct
Verifying whether a certain proof of a given sequent is valid or not.
